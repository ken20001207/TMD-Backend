# TMD Backend

Project TMD (Too Many Deadlines) is a Arduino project, one of my homework.

This is the Restful API backend written with Python Django.

## Steps to Start Development

1. Clone this repo.
2. `python3 -m venv env` Create a virtual env
3. Enter the virtual environment, you should see a `(env)` in the begining of your terminal.
4. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` Install packages
5. `python3 manage.py runserver 8080` Start dev server at http://localhost:8080
